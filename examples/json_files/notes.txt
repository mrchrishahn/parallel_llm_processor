This is a sample text file that contains some notes about the project.

It demonstrates how the file combination feature can handle mixed file types:
- JSON files will be parsed and their keys extracted as columns
- Text files will have their content stored in a text_content column
- The system handles different file types gracefully

This feature is useful for consolidating data from various sources into a single CSV for analysis.
